Description: The goal of 'vetiver' is to provide fluent tooling to version,
    share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both
    recording and checking the model's input data prototype, and
    predicting from a remote API endpoint. The 'vetiver' package is
    extensible, with generics that can support many kinds of models.
