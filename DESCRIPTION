Description: The goal of 'vetiver' is to provide fluent tooling to
    version, share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle
    both recording and checking the model's input data prototype, and
    predicting from a remote API endpoint. The 'vetiver' package is
    extensible, with generics that can support many kinds of models.
