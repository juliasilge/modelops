Description: A trained model can be shared and versioned via 'pins',
    deployed as an API via 'plumber', and monitored via a dashboard
    created with 'rmarkdown'. Functions handle recording and checking the
    model's input data prototype, predicting from a remote API endpoint,
    and monitoring model performance. This extensible framework provides
    generics that can support many kinds of models.
