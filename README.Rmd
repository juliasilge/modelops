> _Vetiver, the oil of tranquility, is used as a stabilizing ingredient in perfumery to preserve more volatile fragrances._

The goal of vetiver is to provide fluent tooling to version, share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both recording and checking the model's input data prototype, and predicting from a remote API endpoint. The vetiver package is extensible, with generics that can support many kinds of models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of vetiver from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("vetiver")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/vetiver")
```

## Example

A `vetiver_model()` object collects the information needed to store, version, and deploy a trained model. 

```{r}
library(vetiver)
cars_lm <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
v <- vetiver_model(cars_lm, "cars_linear")
v
```

You can **version** and **share** your `vetiver_model()` by choosing a [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com) "board" for it, including a local folder, RStudio Connect, Amazon S3, and more.

```{r}
library(pins)
model_board <- board_temp()
model_board %>% vetiver_pin_write(v)
```

You can **deploy** your pinned `vetiver_model()` via a [Plumber API](https://www.rplumber.io/), which can be [hosted in a variety of ways](https://www.rplumber.io/articles/hosting.html).


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plumber)
pr() %>%
  vetiver_pr_predict(v) %>%
  pr_run(port = 8088)
```

If the deployed model endpoint is running via one R process (either remotely on a server or locally, perhaps via a [background job in the RStudio IDE](https://solutions.rstudio.com/r/jobs/)), you can make predictions with that deployed model and new data in another, separate R process.

``` r
endpoint <- vetiver_endpoint("http://127.0.0.1:8088/predict")
predict(endpoint, mtcars[4:7, -1])
#> # A tibble: 4 x 1
#>   .pred
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  21.2
#> 2  17.7
#> 3  20.4
#> 4  14.4
```
