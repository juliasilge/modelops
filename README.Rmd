The goal of modelops is to provide fluent tooling to version, share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both recording and checking the model's input data prototype, and predicting from a remote API endpoint. The modelops package is extensible, with generics that can be supported by many kinds of models. For an example of how to use and extend the modelops package, see [deploytidymodels](https://github.com/tidymodels/deploytidymodels).

## Installation

~~You can install the released version of modelops from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:~~

``` r
install.packages("modelops") ## not yet
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/modelops")
```

## Example

A `modelops()` object collects the information needed to store, version, and deploy a trained model. 

You can **version** and **share** your model by choosing a [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/dev/) "board" for it, including a local folder, RStudio Connect, Amazon S3, and more.

```{r}
library(modelops)
library(pins)

model_board <- board_temp()
cars_lm <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
m <- modelops(cars_lm, "cars_linear", model_board)
m
```

You can **deploy** your `modelops()` object via a [Plumber API](https://www.rplumber.io/), which can be [hosted in a variety of ways](https://www.rplumber.io/articles/hosting.html).

The `modelops_pin_router()` function stores/versions the model on its board and creates a Plumber router with a POST endpoint for prediction.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plumber)
modelops_pin_router(m) %>%
    pr_run(port = 8088)
```

Make predictions with your deployed model at its endpoint and new data.

``` r
endpoint <- modelops_endpoint("http://127.0.0.1:8088/predict")
predict(endpoint, mtcars[4:7, -1])
#> # A tibble: 4 x 1
#>   .pred
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  21.2
#> 2  17.7
#> 3  20.4
#> 4  14.4
```
